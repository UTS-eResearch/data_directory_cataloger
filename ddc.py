'''
This is the Data Directory Cataloger. The purpose of it is to help manage numerous
directories of data by having a README.yaml in most directories and which stores
metadata about the contents of that directory.

This program expects a "top level" directory as input.

Under this top level directory it then looks for subdirectories, but only ONE level down.
In each first level subdirectory it looks for the README.yaml file that should describe
the data under that subdirectory.

Once it has found the README.yaml file it parses that file, and appends the metadata
to a Markdown document summarising the metadata in the READMEs.

This Markdown doc is just printed to standard output so it can be viewed or redirected
to an output file. Single output files can be converted to HTML using pandoc or if you
have many Markdown docs they can be used for the content of a static website generator
such as MkDocs.

To get help for using the program just run: ./ddc.py -h
