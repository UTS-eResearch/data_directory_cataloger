'''
This is the data directory cataloger. The purpose of it is to help manage 
numerous directories by having a README.yaml in most directories and which 
stores metadata about the contents of that directory.

This program expects a "base" directory as input. 

Under this base directory it then looks for subdirectories, but only ONE level down.
In each first level subdirectory it looks for the README.yaml file that should describe 
the data under that subdirectory.

Once it has found the README.yaml file it parses that file, and appends the metadata 
to a Markdown document summarising the metadata in the READMEs. 

This Markdown doc is just printed to standard output so it can be viewed or redirected 
to an output file. The output file can be converted to a HTML file using pandoc.
